			This example page illustrates a bug in WebKit, where an SVG loaded from an external resource
			via SVG <code>&lt;use&gt;</code> will look for named elements in the importing document,
			rather than within itself.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first link illustrates correct usage, where the external SVG file includes both the named
			filter, and the element that references it. This example should render a white circle on a
			white background, surrounded by a blurred gray shadow. This example works correctly in Blink
			and Gecko, but fails in WebKit.

			The second link illustrates the incorrect usage that WebKit seemsto expect, where the external
			SVG file includes the element that references the filter, but the filter definition is
			present in the importing document, in an inline SVG. This example should an entirely white
			image, as both the circle and background are white, and the filter definition should be found
			missing. This example works correctly in Blink and Gecko, but fails in WebKit by rendering
			a white circle on a	white background, surrounded by a blurred gray shadow.
